      <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Using a medium-sized bowl, mix dry seasonings until homogeneous</li>
          <li>Coat 2" chunks of pork tenderloin entirely in seasoning mixture</li>
          <li>Set Instant Pot to saute setting and heat oil. Then using tongs, fry all sides of the pork until exterior is brown 
            <p><em>Don't worry about cooking through, this is just to sear the meat. It will cook thoroughly in the next steps</em></p></li>
          <li>Remove pork from Instant Pot and pour in 1 cup of broth. Using a wooden spoon, deglaze the pot</li>
          <li>Set the Instant Pot to pressure cook setting. Stir together the remaining broth, 1 cup of barbecue sauce, the tobasco sauce, bourbon, and the apple cider vinegar, and add mixture to the pot</li>
          <li>Return the seared pork to the pot with the mixture and seal. Set cook time for 40 minutes</li>
          <li>After 40 minutes, let the pot release pressure naturally for <strong>10 minutes</strong>, then hit the quick release</li>
          <li>Drain liquid from the pot, then stire in the remaining 1 cup of barbecue sauce</li>
          <li>Using a fork, pull the pork so it's stringy. The should should be tender enough that it shouldn't take much effort at all</li>
          <li>Use the pulled pork for sandwiches, tacos, topping for nachos, or whatever else your creative little brain can think of. Enjoy!</li>

    <h3>A classic chicken sandwich sure to appease anyones appetite</h3>
      <p>Unlike most recipes you'll find online, this one didn't come from my great grand uncle, who brought it back from Germany during World War II, and it wasn't found in the attic of someone's dear late aunt after an estate sale. This recipe came from years and years of perfecting the crispiest, tender-ist, juiciest fried chicken that I could have ever imagined creating.</p>
      <p>After finally discovering the perfect ratios of flour to baking soda to cayenne pepper to buttermilk, I'm finally confident to say this recipe that follows is sure to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken <strong>thighs</strong>, cut in half</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>3 tbsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fine sea salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp <strong>smoked</strong> paprika</li>
        <li>2 tbsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tbsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chile powder</li>
        <li><em>optional</em> hamburger buns</li>
        <li><em>optional</em> sandwich pickles</li>
        <li><em>optional</em> slaw</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix 1 tbsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp ground pepper, 1 tsp sea salt, 1 tbsp smoked paprika, 1 tbsp garlic powder, and 1 tbsp onion powder with 2 cups of buttermilk, until seasonings are fully dissolved and buttermilk is orange in color</li>
        <li>Marinate chicken thighs in buttermilk mixture for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight</li>
        <li>Fill a large heavy-bottom pot with at least 2 inches deep of vegetable oil and heat the oil to 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Mix together remaining seasonings with baking powder and all purpose flour. Use a spoon to add drops of the buttermilk mixture into the flour mixture. This will make your chicken extra flaky and perfect.</li>
        <li>Dip marinated chicken thighs, one at a time, into the flour mixture, covering the chicken and using your hands to push the flour ino the chicken. Make sure to coat every inch of the chicken. Repeat with all chicken thigh pieces</li>
        <li>SLowly lay coated chicken, one at a time, into the hot oil. Fry for 4-6 minutes, or until golden brown and internal temperature reaches 160 degrees.</li>
        <li>Set cooked chicken on bun and top with slaw and pickles. Then crown your king. Enjoy</li>
